AI Agent guided project part of Boot.dev's curriculum.

### Sample project: Calculator

The agent needs some project to work on, so Boot.dev provides a calculator package.

- `cd` into the calculator directory and run the tests:
    ```sh
    uv run tests.py
    ```

- run the calculator:
    ```sh
    uv run main.py "3 + 5"
    ```
